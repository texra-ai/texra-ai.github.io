# LaTeX Compilation Environment

While TeXRA focuses on AI-assisted editing and generation of LaTeX source code, several features rely on having a working LaTeX distribution installed on your system for tasks like compiling previews or processing generated `latexdiff` files.

## Required LaTeX Distribution

You need a functional LaTeX distribution installed, such as:

- **Windows**: MiKTeX or TeX Live
- **macOS**: MacTeX (includes TeX Live)
- **Linux**: TeX Live (often available via package manager)

Getting LaTeX set up correctly can sometimes feel like wrestling an octopus, but it's necessary for features like compiling diffs and TikZ previews.

Ensure that the `latexmk` command is available (preferred for TeXRA) or at least `pdflatex`. These should be accessible from your system's command line.

See the main [Installation Guide](./installation.md) for more details on installing LaTeX and other essential dependencies like Perl (required for `latexdiff`).

## Integration with LaTeX Workshop

TeXRA is designed to work smoothly alongside the popular [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension, which provides excellent compilation, previewing, and IntelliSense features.

**Workflow Interaction:**

TeXRA leverages LaTeX Workshop when available. For example, after generating a comparison file using its `latexdiff` features (see [LaTeX Diff guide](./latex-diff.md)), TeXRA attempts to automatically trigger LaTeX Workshop's build and view commands. This allows you to quickly compile and see the visualized changes in the resulting PDF.

**Recommended Setting:**

To keep your project directory clean, it's highly recommended to configure LaTeX Workshop to place its build output files (like `.aux`, `.log`, `.pdf`) into a separate subdirectory. TeXRA is aware of this common practice.

You can configure this setting via:

1.  Open VS Code Settings (<i class="codicon codicon-gear"></i> icon or `Ctrl+,`).
2.  Search for `Latex-workshop: Latex: Out Dir`.
3.  Set the value to `./build` or `%DIR%/build`.

This directs build files to a `build/` subdirectory within your project, preventing clutter in your main source directory. While TeXRA primarily works with the source `.tex` files, having a clean setup benefits the overall workflow, especially when using LaTeX Workshop for compilation and previewing.

## Alternative: Online Compilers (e.g., Overleaf)

Setting up and maintaining a local LaTeX distribution can sometimes be challenging due to complex dependencies or system configurations. If you encounter persistent issues with local compilation for previewing `latexdiff` outputs or TikZ figures, using an online LaTeX editor and compiler like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) can be a convenient alternative. You can upload the `.tex` files generated by TeXRA (like diff files or standalone TikZ files) to Overleaf to compile and view them there.
