# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for technical terms used throughout the TeXRA documentation. Reference this resource to understand specific terminology related to TeXRA, AI models, LaTeX, and academic research.

## TeXRA-Specific Terms

### Agent

A specialized AI assistant in TeXRA that performs a specific type of task, such as correcting errors, polishing writing, or creating figures. Each agent has custom prompts and settings optimized for its purpose.

### Chain of Thought (CoT)

An agent type in TeXRA that uses structured XML output with scratchpad thinking for complex reasoning. CoT agents can show their work and reasoning process.

### Direct Agent

An agent type in TeXRA that provides simpler, more straightforward output without intermediate reasoning steps. Direct agents are optimized for less complex tasks.

### Intelligent Merge

A feature that combines changes from multiple document versions by understanding the context and intent of modifications, rather than just performing text-level merging.

### LaTeX Diff

A feature that compares two LaTeX documents and generates a new document with additions, deletions, and modifications visually highlighted.

### ProgressBoard

TeXRA's logging interface that shows detailed information about the processing steps, model responses, and any issues encountered during execution.

### Tool Config

Settings that control how TeXRA interacts with external tools and processes, including reflection, TeX counting, and prefilling options.

### Auto Extract

A feature that automatically identifies and extracts figures or TikZ diagrams from LaTeX documents for processing by AI models.

### Reflection

A process where the AI reviews and improves its own work, leading to higher quality outputs. Enabled through the "Reflect" option in tool config.

## AI and Language Model Terms

### LLM (Large Language Model)

An AI system trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Examples include Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini.

### Token

The basic unit of text processed by language models. Tokens are typically word fragmentsâ€”a word might be one or several tokens depending on its length and complexity. Models have limits on how many tokens they can process at once.

### Context Window

The maximum number of tokens a language model can consider at one time, including both the prompt and the generated response. Larger context windows allow for processing longer documents.

### Temperature

A parameter that controls the randomness of model outputs. Lower values (0.0-0.3) produce more deterministic, focused responses, while higher values (0.7-1.0) produce more creative, varied responses.

### Prompt

Instructions and context provided to an AI model to guide its response. In TeXRA, prompts are carefully engineered for specific academic research tasks.

### API (Application Programming Interface)

A set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. TeXRA uses APIs to interact with language models from providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google.

### Vision Capability

The ability of some AI models to process and understand images in addition to text. Models with vision capability can analyze figures, diagrams, and other visual elements.

### Reasoning

The process by which an AI model works through complex problems step by step. Models with explicit reasoning capabilities show their thought process.

### Embedding

A numerical representation of text that captures semantic meaning, allowing AI models to understand relationships between concepts.

### Hallucination

When an AI model generates information that is factually incorrect or not based on its input. TeXRA's structured approach helps minimize hallucinations in academic research.

## LaTeX and Document Terms

### LaTeX

A document preparation system especially suited for scientific and mathematical content. LaTeX uses plain text markup rather than visual formatting, allowing precise control over document structure and appearance.

### TikZ

A powerful LaTeX package for creating vector graphics programmatically. TikZ is particularly useful for academic and technical documents because it integrates seamlessly with LaTeX.

### latexdiff

A tool that compares two LaTeX files and marks up significant differences, generating a new LaTeX document with changes highlighted.

### latexindent

A tool that formats LaTeX documents with consistent indentation and structure, making them more readable and maintainable.

### texcount

A tool that analyzes LaTeX documents to count words, headings, equations, and other elements, providing detailed document statistics.

### Document Class

A LaTeX specification that defines the overall structure and formatting of a document. Common classes include article, report, book, and beamer.

### Package

A LaTeX extension that provides additional functionality. LaTeX packages enable features like custom formatting, specialized symbols, or specific document elements.

### Preamble

The portion of a LaTeX document before the `\begin{document}` command, containing document class declarations, package imports, and custom command definitions.

### Environment

A LaTeX structure delimited by `\begin{name}` and `\end{name}` commands that defines a specific context for content formatting, such as figures, tables, or equations.

### BibTeX/BibLaTeX

Systems for managing bibliographies in LaTeX documents, allowing automatic formatting of citations and references according to specific styles.

## Academic Writing Terms

### Abstract

A concise summary of a research paper that provides an overview of its purpose, methodology, findings, and conclusions.

### Bibliography

A list of sources cited in a document, formatted according to a specific citation style.

### Citation

A reference to a source of information, typically formatted according to a specific style guide (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).

### Literature Review

A comprehensive analysis of existing research related to a specific topic, identifying patterns, gaps, and relationships between different works.

### Methodology

The section of a research paper that describes the procedures and techniques used to conduct the research.

### Peer Review

The evaluation of scholarly work by others in the same field, typically to assess its suitability for publication.

### Proceedings

A collection of academic papers presented at a conference or workshop.

### Revision

The process of modifying a document to improve its quality, clarity, or accuracy.

### Thesis/Dissertation

A substantial research document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree.

### Technical Report

A document that describes the process, progress, or results of technical or scientific research.

## File Management Terms

### Auxiliary Files

Supporting files needed for document processing, such as LaTeX class files, style files, or bibliography databases.

### Reference Files

Documents that provide examples or additional context for the AI, such as sample documents or published papers with similar content.

### Figure Files

Image files used in a document, including various formats like PNG, JPG, PDF, or SVG.

### Output Files

Files generated by TeXRA after processing input documents. These follow a naming pattern that includes the agent and model used.

### Working Directory

The main directory where TeXRA operates, typically the root of your project or document collection.

### Git Repository

A version-controlled storage of your project files that tracks changes over time, enabling comparison and collaboration.

### Commit

A snapshot of changes made to files in a Git repository, representing a specific version of the project.

## Tool Integration Terms
