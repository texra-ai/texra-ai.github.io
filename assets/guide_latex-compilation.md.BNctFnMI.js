These should be accessible from your system&#39;s command line.</p><p>See the main <a href="./installation.html">Installation Guide</a> for more details on installing LaTeX and other essential dependencies like Perl (required for <code>latexdiff</code>).</p><h2 id="integration-with-latex-workshop" tabindex="-1">Integration with LaTeX Workshop <a class="header-anchor" href="#integration-with-latex-workshop" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Integration with LaTeX Workshop&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TeXRA is designed to work smoothly alongside the popular <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LaTeX Workshop</a> extension, which provides excellent compilation, previewing, and IntelliSense features.</p><p><strong>Workflow Interaction:</strong></p><p>TeXRA leverages LaTeX Workshop when available. For example, after generating a comparison file using its <code>latexdiff</code> features (see <a href="./latex-diff.html">LaTeX Diff guide</a>), TeXRA attempts to automatically trigger LaTeX Workshop&#39;s build and view commands. This allows you to quickly compile and see the visualized changes in the resulting PDF.</p><p><strong>Recommended Setting:</strong></p><p>To keep your project directory clean, it&#39;s highly recommended to configure LaTeX Workshop to place its build output files (like <code>.aux</code>, <code>.log</code>, <code>.pdf</code>) into a separate subdirectory. TeXRA is aware of this common practice.</p><p>You can configure this setting via:</p><ol><li>Open VS Code Settings (<i class="codicon codicon-gear"></i> icon or <code>Ctrl+,</code>).</li><li>Search for <code>Latex-workshop: Latex: Out Dir</code>.</li><li>Set the value to <code>./build</code> or <code>%DIR%/build</code>.</li></ol><p>This directs build files to a <code>build/</code> subdirectory within your project, preventing clutter in your main source directory. While TeXRA primarily works with the source <code>.tex</code> files, having a clean setup benefits the overall workflow, especially when using LaTeX Workshop for compilation and previewing.</p><h2 id="alternative-online-compilers-e-g-overleaf" tabindex="-1">Alternative: Online Compilers (e.g., Overleaf) <a class="header-anchor" href="#alternative-online-compilers-e-g-overleaf" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Alternative: Online Compilers (e.g., Overleaf)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Setting up and maintaining a local LaTeX distribution can sometimes be challenging due to complex dependencies or system configurations. If you encounter persistent issues with local compilation for previewing <code>latexdiff</code> outputs or TikZ figures, using an online LaTeX editor and compiler like <a href="https://www.overleaf.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Overleaf</a> can be a convenient alternative. You can upload the <code>.tex</code> files generated by TeXRA (like diff files or standalone TikZ files) to Overleaf to compile and view them there.</p>',19)]))}const h=i(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,h as default};
